# Manual Testing Interview Questions by Topic

---

## 1. Functional Testing

### Q1. What is functional testing?

**Answer:** Functional testing verifies that each function of the software operates in conformance with the requirement specification. It focuses on user requirements and is usually black-box testing.

### Q2. What are some key techniques used in functional testing?

**Answer:** Techniques include boundary value analysis, equivalence partitioning, decision table testing, and use case testing.

### Q3. How do you ensure test coverage in functional testing?

**Answer:** By mapping test cases to requirements using a Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM), ensuring all functions are tested.

### Q4. What is the difference between functional and non-functional testing?

**Answer:** Functional testing focuses on what the system does, while non-functional testing evaluates how the system performs (e.g., performance, usability).

### Q5. Can you give an example of a functional test case?

**Answer:** For a login form: Verify that valid credentials allow access and invalid credentials display an error message.

## 2. Regression Testing

### Q1. What is regression testing?

**Answer:** Regression testing ensures that recent code changes havenâ€™t negatively affected the existing functionality.

### Q2. When should regression testing be performed?

**Answer:** It should be performed after any code changes, bug fixes, enhancements, or new feature additions.

### Q3. How do you select test cases for regression testing?

**Answer:** Prioritize based on impact, criticality, and frequently used functionalities. Reuse previous test cases and include high-risk areas.

### Q4. What tools are used for regression testing?

**Answer:** Tools include Selenium, QTP/UFT, TestNG, JUnit, and automated CI/CD pipelines.

### Q5. Is regression testing manual or automated?

**Answer:** It can be both, but automation is preferred for faster, repeatable execution.

## 3. Agile Methodologies

### Q1. What is Agile testing?

**Answer:** Agile testing is a practice that follows the principles of Agile development. Testing is continuous, iterative, and done in collaboration with the development team.

### Q2. What are the ceremonies in Agile where testers are involved?

**Answer:** Testers are involved in sprint planning, daily stand-ups, sprint reviews, and retrospectives.

### Q3. What is the role of a tester in an Agile team?

**Answer:** A tester collaborates closely with developers and BAs to write user stories, acceptance criteria, test cases, and perform continuous testing.

### Q4. What are user stories and how do you test them?

**Answer:** User stories are short descriptions of a feature from the end user's perspective. Testers write test cases based on acceptance criteria and validate expected outcomes.

### Q5. How is testing different in Agile compared to the Waterfall model?

**Answer:** In Agile, testing is continuous and starts from day one, unlike in Waterfall where testing is done after development.

## 4. Adhoc Testing

### Q1. What is adhoc testing?

**Answer:** Adhoc testing is informal, unstructured testing without test cases, aimed at finding defects by exploring the application.

### Q2. When do you perform adhoc testing?

**Answer:** It is performed when there is limited time or documentation, or after formal testing is done to uncover hidden bugs.

### Q3. What skills are needed for effective adhoc testing?

**Answer:** Strong domain knowledge, creativity, intuition, and a good understanding of the system under test.

### Q4. Is documentation required in adhoc testing?

**Answer:** Generally, no formal documentation is required, but it is good practice to log any critical issues found.

### Q5. What is the difference between exploratory and adhoc testing?

**Answer:** Exploratory testing is more structured and involves simultaneous test design and execution. Adhoc is random and less formal.

## 5. SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)

### Q1. What is SDLC?

**Answer:** SDLC is the process of developing software through a series of phases including planning, analysis, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance.

### Q2. What are the phases of SDLC?

**Answer:** Phases include Requirement Gathering, Design, Development, Testing, Deployment, and Maintenance.

### Q3. What are the common SDLC models?

**Answer:** Waterfall, Agile, V-Model, Spiral, and Iterative.

### Q4. What is the tester's role in SDLC?

**Answer:** Involvement starts from requirement analysis to testing and feedback in all phases. Early involvement improves quality.

### Q5. What is the benefit of SDLC?

**Answer:** SDLC provides a structured approach that improves quality, reduces risks, and ensures successful software delivery.

## 6. STLC (Software Testing Life Cycle)

### Q1. What is STLC?

**Answer:** STLC is the series of activities carried out during the testing of software to ensure quality and completeness.

### Q2. What are the phases of STLC?

**Answer:** Requirement Analysis, Test Planning, Test Case Development, Test Environment Setup, Test Execution, Test Closure.

### Q3. When does STLC start?

**Answer:** STLC starts as soon as the requirement phase begins, often alongside the SDLC.

### Q4. What happens in the Test Closure phase?

**Answer:** Test summary reports, defect analysis, lessons learned, and sign-offs are performed in the closure phase.

### Q5. What is the benefit of STLC?

**Answer:** It ensures a systematic approach to testing, resulting in better test coverage, documentation, and defect management.

## 7. Exploratory Testing

### Q1. What is exploratory testing?

**Answer:** Exploratory testing is simultaneous test design and execution, where testers explore the application based on their intuition and experience.

### Q2. What are the benefits of exploratory testing?

**Answer:** It uncovers unexpected issues quickly, is flexible, and relies on tester creativity and knowledge.

### Q3. Is exploratory testing documented?

**Answer:** It can be partially documented using session-based testing with charters, notes, and findings.

### Q4. When is exploratory testing most useful?

**Answer:** When there is limited documentation, tight deadlines, or for learning new systems quickly.

### Q5. How is exploratory testing different from scripted testing?

**Answer:** Scripted testing follows predefined test cases, while exploratory testing is dynamic and design-on-the-fly.
